        <h1 class="display-1">Dreams and Aspirations I</h1>
        <p id="date"><b>June 25, 2023</b></p>

        <p>It's already nearing the end of June and I haven't made a post. Meanwhile, I've been wanting to start posting daily, but haven't gotten into the habit. Today I hope to start.</p>

        <p>Since the summer has started officially officially (it had already started officially in May, but now it's feeling really official), it's time for my annual plan to reach my dreams and aspirations by the end of the summer. It usually fails, but it's worth a try. I'll have to work on these on the side while working on research, so it's about time I get more systematic and disciplined to optimize my use of time. This being said, take this post with a grain of salt. Like I titled it, these are my <i>dreams</i> and <i>aspirations</i>. It's honestly possible (and maybe even probable) that I won't fully achieve the following, but I don't want a goal that will be easy. I like to make the level of my goals high to improve my vertical. Now I feel kind of silly for writing this post, but here goes nothing.</p>

        <p>This summer, I'm really craving mathematical tools. Specifically, despite my relative happiness with my progress so far with my mathematical curriculum, I still feel that I have a really long way to go, and I want to make some (relatively) big steps towards sight-seeing the infinite lands of mathematics this summer. Initially, I had planned to do this by studying a few major subjects this summer: differential topology, algebraic topology, commutative algebra/algebraic geometry, and analysis and measure theory (by solidifying my real/complex analysis and then learning functional analysis). I've started reading <i>Differential Topology</i> by Guillemin and Pollack, <i>Algebraic Topology</i> by Allen Hatcher, watching a lecture series I found on YouTube on Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry while reading the famous book by Hartshorne, and reading Bartle's book on Measure Theory. To be brutally honest, though, I haven't been as disciplined with it as I wanted to be and haven't been making progress on track with the ambitions of my goals. I think part of the reason for this is that I've been trying to read too much different material too quickly, and I've been somewhat skipping out on doing tons of exercises to improve my speed, which I now feel was the worst possible decision I could have made. My reading list has simply grown massive while my utility from reading has probably diminished. I've also slightly changed the perspective of my goals; now, I want to gain an initial understanding and mastery of the topics listed in UChicago's First year courses for their graduate program, which are listed at <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/graduate2/first-year-courses/"></a>http://math.uchicago.edu/graduate2/first-year-courses/</a>.</p>

        <p>Math isn't my only goal this summer, however. In addition to doing amazing research and performing well in a class I'm taking as a prerequisite for more interesting things at Berkeley, I want to maybe participate in some computer science competitions and learn some more machine learning. Additionally, I want to improve my physical strength and mobility through calisthenics and weight lifting, and I want to start my YouTube channel (which I wanted to have started by Schr√∂dinger's birthday).</p>

        <p>Of course, to achieve all of these goals I'll need a good training program. That's what I want to plan out with this blog post. I tend to set extremely high expectations for myself, so this is a first draft, and I'll probably change things in the coming days as I start to implement my program.</p>
        
        <p>To start off, I'll probably want to go to sleep at roughly 1 PM EST every day and wake up at roughly 9 PM EST. This might be a somewhat drastic change from my current sleeping habits unfortunately, since I've somehow been sleeping very late. I'll have one day to adjust, which will hopefully be enough.</p>

        <p>I will have some fixed blocks in my schedule, corresponding to research meetings, labs for my class, and activities such as eating and showering. I believe these fixed blocks should take roughly 5 hours a day, leaving me with 11 hours each day to allocate to daily activities and my goals. While I will make sure to achieve all my goals, it's probably a good idea to have a priority system, to determine how my time should be allocated in the event that I do not have enough time to allocate to each of my activities. In this case, I will have the following priority system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Research and School work</li>
            <li>Math self-studying</li>
            <li>Physical training and YouTube</li>
            <li>Computer Science Competitions and Machine Learning</li>
        </ol>
        <p>and in the event that I have an issue where two items of the same priority are impossible to do in time, I'll have to work out a solution when the time comes (which I'm fairly confident shouldn't).</p>

        <p>The following timings are somewhat flexible based on how much actual work I have for that day, and are based mainly on my anticipation. Since I'll have 11 hours left, assigning these hours based on priority, I'll assign 8 hours to research and school work. Usually, I finish my school work during the fixed block sessions, so I believe a marginal amount of time should be dedicated to this. Instead, I'll likely be dedicating almost all of that time to research (accounting for both actually working on projects and also learning supplementary material which could be of use to my current research and future research). This would leave 3 hours for other things. I'll assign 2 hours to math self-studying (luckily, part of my math goals will be handled as I study for my research). However, I plan to take an unconventional approach, which is to study during my physical training workouts. I'll explain this more below. Finally, I'll use the remaining hour of my day as a rotational block which can be applied to any of my goals, but mainly the goals that are currently lacking (normalized by priority).</p>

        <p>I think it's more optimal to spend an hour of focused mathematics studying and one hour of problem solving. It's during this problem solving period that I intend to work out. Rather than studying definitions or learning something absolutely new, something I <i>can</i> do in between sets is think about math problems. In fact, when I get distracted when studying math right now, I tend to take a break by doing push-ups (hahaha technically though I only end up doing like 10-15 because I'm a bit weak and the second time I get distracted is probably the time I stop studying for the day unfortunately). So as part of my new plan, I'll use the second hour of my math studying as a mental + physical training session where I work out while solving a list of problems I'll have compiled on my phone or printed. A bit strange, but maybe it'll work.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I plan to work out four to five days every week, so I'll have three days of focused math training. I anticipate that in addition to the time I'll spend on math from research, I'll be spending roughly 2-5 hours daily on math assuming all goes well. This is a fair amount, so I anticipate that I may actually come close to achieving my goals if all goes well and I can stick through it (it may take a few days to actually get into it though).</p>

        <p>In terms of my physical workouts, I initially wanted to focus on hypertrophy, but I've been thinking of trying Candito LP with 4 days. I've heard that nSuns is better, but I've also seen mixed resposnes, and heard that it may be injury prone, especially for people with lower body weights. Because of that, I wanted to stay away from nSuns and focus on bulking a bit while doing Candito. I'll have to see how it goes and update here as I make progress.</p>

        <p>Welp, it's pretty late and I think that's enough dreaming for now. For now, my goals for tomorrow are to implement the above. I plan to spend 6 hours on math reading tomorrow, focused on the Rudin series as well as some functional analysis. Until tomorrow!</p>
