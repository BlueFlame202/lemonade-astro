        <p id="date"><b>February 22, 2023</b></p>
        
        <p>Today is two day! Happy Two day!</p>

        <p>If you still haven't figured it out, today is 2/22. Since 2 is such an amazing number (and happens to be my favorite), every year I like to celebrate the occassion. This year, I'll use this blog post to dicuss some nice facts about 2 as well as another idea I had when thinking about a CS 70 problem.</p>

        <h2 class="display-4" id="two-facts">This Year's Facts</h2>

        <p>Here are $2^2 = 2 \times 2 = 2 + 2$ facts about 2!</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Fact.</b> $2$ is the smallest prime.
        </div>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Fact.</b> $2$ is the largest $n$ such that $S_n$ is an abelian group.
        </div>
        <i>Proof follows from </i>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Fact.</b> Every positive integer, based on the axioms of Zermelo-Frankel (ZF) Set Theory, contains two elements.
        </div>
        <i>Based on ZF, each positive integer is the union of the previous integer and the empty set, so it has two elements.</i>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Fact.</b> The only two distinct metrics (up to equivalence) on the rationals are the $p$-adic metric and the traditional $|a - b|$ metric.
        </div>
        <i>Ostrowski's Theorem, which has a pretty nice proof.</i>

        <h2 class="display-4" id="cs70">The CS 70 Glitch</h2>

        <div class="problem"><b>Problem.</b> Suppose $f_1((a,b)) = (a-1,b+1)$ and $f_2((a,b)) = (0,a+b)$ for integers $a,b$. Show that repeated composition of $f_1$ and $f_2$ applied to $(1,1)$ will never yield $(1,2)$.</div>

        <p>At first, my solution was the following (a post I made in our Ed Discussion):</p>
        <i>Proof.</i>

        <p>To piggy back off of this, here's a nice but possibly long way to show that 1/2 cannot be obtained: let $S((a,b)) = a + b$ for ordered pairs $(a,b)$. The "next rational" functions in the problem can be represented by $f_1((a,b)) = (a+1,b-1)$ and $f_2((a,b)) = (0,a+b)$. Notice that 
            $$S(f_1((a,b))) = S((a+1,b-1)) = a+1+b-1 = a + b = S((a,b))$$
            $$S(f_2((a,b))) = S((0,a+b)) = 0 + a + b = a + b = S((a,b))$$
            Essentially, the point is that the sum of the numerator and denominator is invariant under these two maps. Since $S((1,1)) = 2$, $S((a,b))$ for any $(a,b)$ the result of composing $f_1$ and $f_2$ and applying to $(1,1)$ should yield $S((a,b)) = 2$ (can be shown via induction or well-ordering principle or "left to the reader") and so since $S((1,2)) = 3 \neq 2$, there is no composition of $f_1$ and $f_2$ applied to $(1,1)$ that yields $(1,2)$. Then again you could just use induction to show that the sequence repeats like $(1,1) \rightarrow (0,2) \rightarrow (1,1) \rightarrow ...$ but I thought this was pretty cool.</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">$\blacksquare$</p>

            <p>Certainly a nice proof. But I was just thinking... is there a nicer way to do this? For example, what if we just squish all of the ordered pairs with invariant $S$ together? This could be done with an equivalence relation and a quotient. Write $(a_1,b_1) \sim (a_2,b_2)$ if and only if $S(a_1,b_1) = S(a_2,b_2)$. It is fairly easy to show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Then we can consider $(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z})/\sim$. Notice that then, $f_1$ and $f_2$ become identity functions, and the result seems much more obvious.</p>
