          <h2>Huh...</h2>
          <p>it seems like <i>rings</i> are super interesting, and I still don&apos;t know them like the back of my hand. That&apos;s why this sketch is dedicated to them.</p>

          <h2>A list of rings to consider...</h2>
          <p>I studied much of what I know about algebra from Dummit and Foote as well as Lang and Matsumura, so many of the examples I will think of were inspired by these sources (and my algebra professors). If anyone has other ideas of useful rings to consider, contact me, I would love to learn to sketch them.</p>

          The integers, rationals and reals which I discussed in Sketch 1 as being nice abelian groups are also rings (and in a future sketch I guess I will also mention that they are fields), with multiplication being well known.
