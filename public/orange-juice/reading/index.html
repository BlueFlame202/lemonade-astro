                <h2 class="read">Selected Books I&apos;ve Read Since May 13th, 2024</h2>
                <p>For all these books, I have solved at least 50% of the problems (usually more), and have at least read all problem statements. This is a change I implemented after my third semester at Berkeley. Ever since then, I have decided to make it a habit of finishing books more thoroughly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Elements of Differential Geometry</i> by Richard S. Millman, George D. Parker</li>

                    <li>What sort of colours do you prefer? <i>Pastel shades.</i></li>
                    <li>Which of the following historic sites would you most like to visit? <i>The Great Pyramid of Giza</i></li>

I thus emphasize the classical roots of the subject. For readers interested in simply seeing what the subject is about, I avoid the more technical details better treated with the most recent methods. For readers interested in pursuing the subject further, I will provide a  basis for understanding the developments of the last half century, which have put the subject on a radically new footing. Based on lectures given at Brown and Harvard Universities, I retain the informal style of the lectures and stresses examples throughout; the theory is developed as needed. My first part is concerned with introducing basic varieties and constructions; I describe, for example, affine and projective varieties, regular and rational maps, and particular classes of varieties such as determinantal varieties and algebraic groups. My second part discusses attributes of varieties, including dimension, smoothness, tangent spaces and cones,  degree, and parameter and moduli spaces. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
            <p>To be honest for the grocery store question I felt equally good about the first three, and for the color question I felt equally good about bright colors and pastel shades, so I could also be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frank Warner&apos;s <i>Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups</i></li>
                <li>William S. Massey&apos;s <i>A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology</i></li>
                <li>Robin Hartshorne&apos;s <i>Algebraic Geometry</i></li>
            </ul>
            I think this feels pretty accurate. ;)

            I think it&apos;s not a bad goal to have to try and finish all of the Springer GTM books. B-) So <a href="reading/gtm-tour">here is a list, see my progress!</a>
