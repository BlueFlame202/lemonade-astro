        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>I hope to do a section for MATH 53 next semester. Wish me luck! :-)</p>

        <h2>University Courses</h2>

        <h3>Class Projects</h3>
        <p>For some classes, I did a project that I put a lot of time into, and really cared about. I like to showcase them here (in descending chronological order).</p>

        <h4>Differential Geometry and Computer Graphics</h4>
        <p>Coming soon üòè</p>

        <h4>Data Structures</h4>
        <p>The last project for this class is one where one has to make a video game. Since the prospect of making games is what got me into coding, I went all out on this project. In the last minute, I even went 3D and implemented my own math classes and the <a href="https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html">ideas detailed here,</a> which I had previously taken somewhat for granted by importing other people's libraries. I also tried out different lighting systems for nice lighting effects (ask me if you're curious, I actually spent some time thinking about this). I also tried to go for a Pokemon-like aesthetic, which is why initially I didn't do 3D, but on the day the project was due I decided there was no way I could submit a project that didn't have 3D in it and made a quick class that could render my 2D game into 3D. My video submission was here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0chMA3DOxe0&t=3s">yay, my build your own world project!</a></p>

        <h4>Honors Complex Analysis</h4>
        <p>I did a presentation based on Neal Koblitz‚Äôs books on $p$-adic numbers and analysis. The notes for my presentation are here: <a href="/orange-juice/classes/final-projects/UCB_MATH_H185_Final_Project_Notes.pdf">yay, some cool notes on $p$-adic Numbers, Analysis, and $\zeta$-function!</a></p>

        <h3>List of Classes</h3>
        <p>I have taken the following classes at universities: (classes prefixed with an A such as MATH A191 are ones that I audited and spent enough time on by doing assignments and going to lectures that I likely wouldn't learn much new taking them officially)</p>

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>I've had my moments... for classes for which I didn't get an A+ or A, you will see duplicates where I audited the class the next time it was offered to ensure that I really mastered the material. This list only includes classes for which I recieved an A or A+, or for classes for which I did not initially meet my personal goals but then re-audited a following semester.</p>
