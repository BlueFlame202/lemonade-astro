I just migrated my blog to AstroJS! This has a lot of benefits for me. The main reason I switched was just to experiment with the tech and see how it felt. So far, it feels good. And boy do they know how to make a VS Code theme!

One thing I miss is Next.js's single page layout, which made switching between my different pages really slick and nice. We'll have to see if I can get that kind of look and feel from AstroJS. For now, things do seem to be loading nicely, but one thing I've noticed is a sort of glitchy feeling as the Montserrat font loads in. I'll have to see if I can fix that. That being said, I've noticed that images on my blog and project pages are loading noticably faster than on Next (although I've only tested Astro locally). There's also this article that kind of convinced me to give it a try: [check this out](https://johnzanussi.com/posts/nextjs-to-astro-migration).

In two days, I'll be taking a quantum mechanics exam! I feel semi-prepared, and solved around half of the problems in the textbook. It's a bit scary though still, and I sort of wasted my time today. We'll see how it goes I guess.

In terms of research, I kind of haven't gotten a chance to look at anything recently, I've been completely preoccupied with quantum mechanics! Thinking about quantum mechanics has been nice though. For one, I think I finally understand Fourier analysis, and I read a little bit about wavelets and wavelet transforms.

Anyway, it's probably past my bedtime, so I should go to sleep. Look forward to quantum mechanics, research, and reading in the upcoming week.
