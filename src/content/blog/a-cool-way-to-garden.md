I recently had some cardboard boxes to spare since I moved into a new apartment, and I was thinking... instead of getting a whole setup for a garden, can't I just plant in these cardboard boxes? Not only does it require less work when I eventually move out at the end of college since I can get rid of the boxes without losing any money or wasting too much material, but it's also a solution to my previous problem: not having deep enough pots to grow things that need a bit more space.

But after checking out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFqHC-1cNeQ, I might be convinced to get a little plastic container instead! Check it out at timestamp 7:15 ish. It looks so colorful and amazing, definitely not as corporate and boring as plain white ceramic pots or the standard clay pots. It's definitely something to consider!
