              <p>Lemonade is a sweet homemade drink made in many parts of the world. Different people make their lemonade differently; it&apos;s one of those things that everyone can take and make their own. On hot summer days, it&apos;s not uncommon to see children setting up lemonade stands on the street for some extra change, for fun, or to give to charity. In fact, lemonade is so positively rooted in our culture that it has even become embedded into the common saying: &quot;when life gives you lemons, make lemonade&quot;. Even when life does not give you lemons, it never hurts to make a nice, cold, and refreshing glass of lemonade.</p>

But it also means Deep \'N Meaningful: https://medium.com/@MissGenY/why-you-should-have-ye-old-dnm-24eb7707c98d. Idk. Interestnig perspectives. What do you think? By the way, there aren\'t too many other easter eggs in this HTML, because the HTML is compiled and generated automatically by Next.js. This comment was just something I forcefully injected for fun. :P See you around! Oh... just one more thing. Check this out: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ. -->
