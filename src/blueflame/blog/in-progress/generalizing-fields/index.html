        <p>This was supposed to be my Two day post, but it took too long to write, so instead I'll use this blog post to capture a result I thought about at some point... (to be honest I don't remember when I thought about this). Feel free to skip the exploration part if you are confident in your algebra definitions or get bored.</p>

        <h2 class="display-4" id="exploration">Exploration</h2>

        <p>First of all, I want to explore various definitions and structures in math. This will flow pretty mathematically rather than with words.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Magma).</b> Consider a set $S$ with (closed) binary operation $\times$. Then $S$ is called a <b>magma</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Semigroup).</b> A magma with an associative operation is a <b>semigroup</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Monoid).</b> Consider a set $S$ with binary operation $\times$, $S$ is a semigroup. If $S$ also satisfies
        <ul>
            <li>$\exists 1 \in S$ such that $\forall s \in S, 1 \times s = s \times 1 = s$</li>
        </ul>
        then we call $S$ a <b>monoid under $\times$</b>. $1 \in S$ is called the <b>identity</b> of $S$ with respect to $\times$.</p>

        <div class="remark">
            <b>Remark.</b> We say "the" identity because it can be shown that the identity is unique: if $s_1,s_2$ satisfy $se_1 = e_1s = s$ for all $s$ and $se_2 = e_2s = s$ for all $s$, then $e_1 = e_1 e_2 = e_2$.
        </div>

        <div class="remark">
            <b>Remark.</b> Sometimes we use <b>multiplicative notation</b>, which means that we write $ab$ instead of writing $a\times b$. Here, the operation is implicit.
        </div>

        <p><b>Definition (Group).</b> Consider $S$ with binary operation $\times$. If $(S, \times)$ is a monoid with identity $1 \in S$ and $\times$ also satisfies:
        <ul>
            <li>$\forall s \in S, \exists s^{-1} \in S$ such that $ss^{-1} = s^{-1}s = 1$</li>
        </ul>
        then we call $S$ a <b>group under $\times$</b>. For all $s$, $s^{-1}$ is called the <b>inverse</b> of $s$.</p>

        <div class="remark">
            <b>Remark.</b> We say "the" inverse because it can be shown that the inverse is unique: if $s_1,s_2$ satisfy $ss_1 = s_1s = ss_2 = s_2s = 1$, then $s_1 = s_1 1 = s_1(ss_2) = (s_1s)s_2 = 1s_2 = s_2$.
        </div>

        <p><b>Definition (Abelian/Commutative).</b> Suppose a binary operation $+ : S \times S \rightarrow S$ satisfies $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in S$. Then we say the operation is <b>abelian</b> or <b>commutative</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Abelian Monoid).</b> We say a monoid is <b>abelian</b> if its operation is commutative.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Abelian Group).</b> We say a group is <b>abelian</b> if its operation is commutative.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Rig/Semiring).</b> Consider a set $S$ with two binary operations $+$ and $\times$. If $S$ is an abelian monoid under $+$ with identity $0 \in S$ and $S$ is a monoid under $\times$ with identity $1 \in S$, and the following <b>distributive properties</b> hold:
            <ul>
                <li>$\forall a,b,c \in S$, $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$</li>
                <li>$\forall a,b,c \in S$, $(b + c) \times a = b \times a + c \times a$</li>
            </ul>
            and additionally,
            <ul>
                <li>$0 \times a = a \times 0 = 0$ for all $a \in S$</li>
            </ul>
            then $S$ is called a <b>rig</b> or <b>semiring</b>.
        </p>

        <div class="remark">
            <b>Remark.</b> It is called a <b>rig</b> because "negatives" (or inverses with respect to $+$) don't necessarily exist.
        </div>

        <p><b>Definition (Rng/Non-unital ring).</b> Consider a set $S$ with two binary operations $+$ and $\times$. If $S$ is an abelian group under $+$ with identity $0 \in S$ and $S$ is a semi-group under $\times$, and the following <b>distributive properties</b> hold: 
            <ul>
                <li>$\forall a,b,c \in S$, $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$</li>
                <li>$\forall a,b,c \in S$, $(b + c) \times a = b \times a + c \times a$</li>
            </ul>
            then $S$ is called a <b>rng</b> or <b>non-unital ring</b>.
        </p>

        <p><b>Definition ((Unital) Ring).</b> A <b>ring</b> or <b>unital ring</b> is an rng such that $S$ is a monoid under $\times$ with identity $1 \in S$. Equivalently, a ring is a rig such that $S$ is an abelian group under $+$. </p>

        <div class="remark">
            <b>Remark.</b> The last condition that $a\times 0 = 0 \times a = 0$ is no longer needed after introducing additive inverses.
        </div>

        <p><b>Definition (Commutative Ring).</b> A <b>commutative ring</b> is a ring such that $S$ is an abelian monoid under $\times$.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Division Ring).</b> A <b>division ring</b> is a ring in which $S/\{0\}$ is a group under $\times$.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Theorem (Wedderburn's Little Theorem).</b> Any finite ring which is a group with respect to $\times$ is also an abelian group with respect to $\times$, or a finite field.
        </div>
        <i>The proof to this theorem seems to be a bit more complicatd than I would like to get in this post, so I'll explore it in a future post.</i>


        <p><b>Definition (Field).</b> A <b>field</b> is a commutative ring where $0 \neq 1$ and $S$ is an abelian group under $\times$.</p>

        <p><b>Definition (Galois Field).</b> A <b>Galois field</b> is a field which is finite.</p>

        <h2 class="display-4" id="theorem">The Theorem</h2>
        <p>The question is... how many operations can we have at the same time on a set? This sounds weird, but the question is inspired by the fact that all of the algebraic structures I listed above only have at most two operaitons. Why not more? Even more interesting, why do we not have a structure which is a set $S$ such that $S$ with $+$ is a monoid and $S$ with $\times$ is a monoid? One explanation is that it may not be very applicable, but a post I saw on Stack Exchange claimed otherwise. Maybe I'll look into this in more detail in a future post.</p>

        <p>For this post, however, I want to consider a <i>finite</i> set $S$ and consider a structure where $S$ is an abelian group with respect to $+$ with identity $e_+$, $S/\{e_+\}$ is an abelian group with respect to $\times$ with identity $e_\times$ (and a monoid when $e_+$ is included), and $S/\{e_\times\}$ is an abelian group with respect to $*$ with identity $e_*$ (and a monoid when $e_\times$ is included). Additionally, we will impose the following distributive laws:
            $$\forall a,b,c \in S, a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$$
            $$\forall a,b,c \in S, a * (b \times c) = a * b \times a * c$$
            and the condition that $e_+ \neq e_\times \neq e_*$. 
        </p>

        <p>This is essentially a generalization of a Galois field to three operations.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <b>Theorem.</b> Suppose $S$ has $p$ elements for some prime $p$.
        </div>
        <i>Proof.</i>

        <p>Since $S$ has $p$ elements, by a well-known theorem, $S$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.</p>
